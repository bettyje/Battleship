## Description
Welcome to the Battleship Project! This repository showcases a demo page for a classic strategy game, Battleship, designed with simple yet effective HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, two players compete to sink each other's ships on a grid, combining elements of strategy and luck.

This implementation provides:
