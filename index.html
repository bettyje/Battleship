        Battleship is a two-player war-themed board game where opponents try to
        guess the location of each other's warships and then sink them. A paper
        and pencil version of the game dates back to World War I, but most
        people are familiar with Battleship through the plastic board game first
        marketed by the Milton Bradley Company in 1967 and now produced by
        Hasbro. Since the launch of the original board game, more Battleship
        variations have become popular, including video games and smartphone
        apps. But, throughout Battleship history, the rules for playing have
        remained relatively the same. So, how do you play Battleship? The game
        is pretty straightforward. Each player places ships on a plastic grid
        containing vertical and horizontal coordinates, but players keep their
        ships' locations secret from their opponent. Players take turns calling
        out row and column coordinates on the other player's grid in an attempt
        to identify a square that contains a ship. The game board each player
        gets has two grids: an upper and a lower. The player uses the lower grid
        to place and hide his ships. He uses the upper grid to record shots
        fired (by calling out coordinates) toward his opponent and to document
        whether those shots were hits or misses.Before play begins, each player
        secretly arranges their ships on their primary grid. Each ship occupies
        a number of consecutive squares on the grid, arranged either
        horizontally or vertically. The number of squares for each ship is
        determined by the type of ship. The ships cannot overlap (i.e., only one
        ship can occupy any given square in the grid) or be placed diagonally.
        The types and numbers of ships allowed are the same for each player.
        These may vary depending on the rules. The ships should be hidden from
        the opposing player's sight and players are not allowed to see each
        other's pieces. The game is a discovery game in which players need to
        discover their opponent's ship positions.

          <h1>Setting up the Game</h1>
          <p>
            Each player receives a game board, five ships of varying lengths (each
            ship has holes to insert the "hit" pegs), and a supply of hit and miss
            markers (white and red pegs).The five ships are: Carrier (five holes)
            Battleship (four holes) Cruiser (three holes) Submarine (three holes)
            Destroyer (two holes) The two players should face each other across a
            game table. Their grids back up to one another so that neither player
            can see his opponent's "ocean" and ship locations. Before the game
            starts, each opponent secretly places his five ships on the ocean grid
            (lower part of the board) by laying out the ships and anchoring them
            into the holes on the grid. Each ship must be placed horizontally or
            vertically across grid spaces—not diagonally—and the ships can't hang
            off the grid. Ships can touch each other, but they can't occupy the same
            grid space. You cannot change the position of the ships after the game
            begins.
          </p>    
        </div>
    </div>
      <h1>Basic Gameplay</h1>
      <p>
        Players take turns firing shots (by calling out a grid coordinate) to
        attempt to hit the opponent's enemy ships. On your turn, call out a
        letter and a number that identifies a row and column on your target
        grid. Your opponent checks that coordinate on their ocean grid and
        verbally responds "miss" if there is no ship there, or "hit" if you have
        correctly guessed a space that is occupied by a ship. Mark each of your
        shots or attempts to fire on the enemy using your target grid (upper
        part of the board), using white pegs to document your misses and red
        pegs to register your hits. As the game proceeds, the red pegs will
        gradually identify the size and location of your opponent's ships. After
        you've taken your turn, it's your opponent's turn to fire shots at you.
        Each time one of your ships receives a hit, put a red peg into the hole
        on the ship corresponding to the grid space. When one of your ships has
        every slot filled with red pegs, you must announce to your opponent that
        your ship is sunk. In classic play, the phrase is "You sunk my
        battleship!" The first player to sink all five of their opponent's ships
        wins the game.
